INSTALL
=======

First, install latest version of NodeJS.

If running on Ububntu, install from the official [nodesource repo](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions).

After cloning Qrate and installing NodeJS, `cd` into the cloned folder and run:

`npm install`
`npm -g install bower gulp`
`bower install`
`gulp`

When committing, use command `npm run commit` instead of `git commit`.

Consult the [Commit Guidelines](ht~tps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines) from the Angular team, we are closely following them.
